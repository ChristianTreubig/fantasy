Use a Lightbox to confirm draft picks:

Handle required fields on predraft form.

Figure out how to get sort/filter functionality into directive so it can be used in both Predraft and Draft views.
	-May want to combine Predraft and Draft into single Controller anyway, which might make directive unnecessary.
	
In Prod, test if multiple connection work at the same time.
