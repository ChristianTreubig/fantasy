	<p>On the next page, you’ll be presented with a list of all players. Each player will have an editable “Price” field in the right-hand column. These serve as your pre-draft values. Edit them to suit your personal preferences/hunches.</p>
	<p>[Summarize source and description of data/stats shown.]</p>
	<p>Select the number of teams in your fantasy league. A budget of $200 per team is assumed.</p>
	<p>Your Price entries are used to construct the initial values for each player’s Recommended Price, which will update throughout the draft.</p>
	<p>The draft tool assigns weightings to each position based upon your Price entries, i.e. if the sum of Prices for quarterbacks is 25% of all Prices, then quarterbacks will be rationed 25% of all money in the draft pool for the duration of the draft. So, if a bunch of quarterbacks go off the board but for relatively little money, it will increase the value of the remaining (scarce) quarterbacks, who will have a lot of money chasing after them. Conversely, if only a few quarterbacks go off the board but for quite a lot of money, it will decrease the value of the remaining (surplus) quarterbacks.</p>
	<p>When you’re done editing, proceed to the draft room. Once there, you must enter each draft pick. The Recommended Price will automatically update with each pick. You can thereby spot whether players currently on the board are undervalued or overvalued, and bid accordingly.</p>
