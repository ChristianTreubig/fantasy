Intro:
	-how it works.

Removed updateOn:change option for player model in predraft (when clicking arrows, it would sort as you clicked).
	-Even blur causes unwanted jumping around when clicking arrows
		-i.e. finish clicking one player's arrow, then page re-sorts right when you click another player's arrow.
	-May need to reintroduce updateAverageAuction().

Debug sorting:
	-In the JSON file, some fields that should be numbers are strings; these fields don't sort correctly.
		-Rewrite FantasySharks JSON file via Python.
	
In predraft, modal to confirm user is ready to proceed to draft when they click that button.

Deal with page reloads, closes, back buttons, etc.

Cool front end stuff:

In Prod, test if multiple connection work at the same time.
